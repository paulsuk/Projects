                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>
                The University of Toronto ChemE Car Design Team is a multidisciplinary design team where undergraduate engineering students work collaboratively on designing and constructing a small car model. The car may only rely on chemical energy sources to safely carry a specified load over a given distance and stop. After a fully functioning car has been constructed and tested, the team travels to the United States to compete in the AIChE (American Institute for Chemical Engineers) Chem-E-Car Regional Competitionâ„¢ against other universities. Upon qualification, the team competes against the best universities internationally at the Annual Student Conference. 
                </p>
                <p>
                We will be competing for the first time in the 2017 Regional Competition.

                <ol>
                    <li>Provide chemical engineers an avenue to gain hands-on experience in a safe laboratory setting, and apply theoretical concepts to solve real word problems. </li>
                    <li>Offer engineering students a true multidisciplinary experience where the expertise of individual disciplines must be combined to accomplish a common goal</li>
                </ol>
